# amazon-crawler
Created a prototype webcrawler using amazon as the main site.

In it's current state, this crawler can be tested locally.


Just simply download the directory.


Run `npm install`


Run `node webcrawler.js`



Your terminal will then begin logging out product info scraped from each amazon PDP it visits.

In future iterations, our next step is to conect this to a database.
